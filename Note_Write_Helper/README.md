# Note Write Helper

# What is it?

Note Write Helper is a plugin I designed in an effort to keep note writing on Aardwolf as painless as possible. It follows the same format as the Note Formatter located at http://wwww.aardwolf.com/note.php, but with this plugin, you never have to leave the screen. Essentially, you can write full paragraphs of text without ever having to worry about line breaks, as the plugin will automatically take care of them for you.

# Commands

There are two commands to use: 'nnw new' and 'nnw reply'. The 'new' parameter will create a new note, and you will be prompted for the board, to whom you're writing it, and the subject, followed lastly by the editor. 'reply' will ask for a note number to reply to.

# Other notes

This has now been upgraded to no longer need to insert a space to process a paragraph break. It has new code in it, so if it breaks, please let me know.

Any questions or bugs, please let me know. Thanks!
