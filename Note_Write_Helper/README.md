# Note Write Helper

# What is it?

Note Write Helper is a plugin I designed in an effort to keep note writing on Aardwolf as painless as possible. It follows the same format as the Note Formatter located at http://wwww.aardwolf.com/note.php, but with this plugin, you never have to leave the screen. Essentially, you can write full paragraphs of text without ever having to worry about line breaks, as the plugin will automatically take care of them for you.

# Commands

There are two commands to use: 'nnw new' and 'nnw reply'. The 'new' parameter will create a new note, and you will be prompted for the board, to whom you're writing it, and the subject, followed lastly by the editor. 'reply' will ask for a note number to reply to.

# Other notes

Currently, the plugin doesn't recognize 'nil' lines, or lines without text in them at all. If you're looking to separate your paragraphs, you'll need to either add '@w' or a space (' ') on the blank lines to separate them.

The only other thing that this plugin cannot handle is long links, or words that are longer than 79 characters. If you're posting a link, you're better off using a URL shortner to post it.

Any questions or bugs, please let me know. Thanks!
