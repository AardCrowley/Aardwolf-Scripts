MUSHclient Scripts for Aardwolf

Some scripts require dependencies, which you will need to ensure you add to your MUSHclient directory.

Issues, requests, questions, let me know. You can reach me on Aardwolf as Arcidayne, or use the Issues feature here.

# Aardwolf Clock

This displays an analog clock that is in sync with the tick timer. It displays the current Aardwolf time, changes the background depending on if it's day or night, shows you sunrise and sunset, displays the seasons as well as the damage type and how much time is left in the season. It also functions as a visual tick timer so you know how close you are to the next tick. Eventually, it'll allow for 3 moons to be displayed, and you will be able to toggle different information if you want.

# Auction Utilities

Simple plugin that lets you click on the lbid ID of an item and have it pop out in a new window. You can bid on it, or proxy bid as well as see the date and time the auction ends. It houses a feature called 'safe' that helps prevent misbids. With it, you can type '1m' to mean 1,000,000 or 10k to mean 10,000. You can utilize it from the command line, as well, by prefixing 'safe' as a command (e.g. safe give <player> 10m gold). More updates and fixes will come eventually.
  
# Contrast Picker
  
A fun little plugin I wrote to help me determine what colors best mesh together when creating backgrounds and colored text. It's a simple plugin, too. You type 'contrast <color>' and it'll display the backrounds your color shows best in. Then you can utilize it in ColourNote().
  
# Epic Groups Not Here
  
A simple plugin to check who is in your group but not in the same room as you.
  
# Note Write Helper
  
This plugin lets you write paragraphs in an edit box without having to worry if you've gone past the line limit as it will format it for you automatically. However, for blank lines, you do have to add something (usually a blank space or @w will suffice). It will not work if you're posting a long link, so you'll have to go back and add that manually.

# Themed Tracker

Simply keeps track of your quests and outputs them in a pretty format, based on colors of your choosing. Needs some bug fixes, however, but works nonetheless.
