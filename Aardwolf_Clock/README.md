# Aardwolf-Scripts
Aardwolf Clock

This is simply a visual cue to the Aardwolf time, including the Season and day of the season. It keeps track of the appropriate sunrise/sunset for each season and changes the background colour based on whether it's considered day time or night time.

A couple of notes:

1. There are options you can change in the plugin. They're scattered about, but the individual sections you can change are commented.
2. There is one section you absolutely MUST change. You need to change the paths to wherever you unzip the Image files to. For example, if you unzipped it to C:\Images, you would need to make the change to "C:/Images/filename.png".

If you have any questions or problems, notify me either on Aardwolf or use the Issue feature.
